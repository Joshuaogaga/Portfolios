                      Stock market prediction and analysis are some of the most difficult jobs to complete. 
                      There are numerous causes for this, including market volatility and a variety of other dependent 
                      and independent variables that influence the value of a certain stock in the market. 
                      These variables make it extremely difficult for any stock market expert to anticipate the rise 
                      and fall of the market with great precision. Considered among the most potent tree-based techniques, 
                      Random Forest can predict the stock process as it can also solve regression-based problems..

                       resources but also outperforms people in terms of performance. it will always prefer to use a trained 
                       computer algorithm since it will advise you based only on facts, numbers, and data and will not factor in 
                       emotions or prejudice. It would be interesting to incorporate sentiment analysis on news & social media 
                       regarding the stock market in general, as well as a given stock of interest.

                          Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency similar to dollars, euros, and yen. The difference is that 
                          instead of the backing of a nation or federal bank, it uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to 
                          secure online transactions. Through cryptocurrency exchanges, one can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. 
                          It can also be “mined.” The popularity of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 as a result of several 
                          months of exponential growth in their market capitalization. With increasing geopolitical and economic
                           issues over the last two years, global currency values have fallen, stock markets have had a bad run, 
                           and investors have lost wealth. This has rekindled interest in digital currencies. Our system aids in 
                           cryptocurrency price prediction using machine learning.
